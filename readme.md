# E-commerce Product Browser Project

## Overview

This project is an e-commerce product browser that allows users to view a list of products, filter them based on search and category, and view detailed information about individual products. The application leverages React.js and React Router for routing and dynamic content rendering.

### Key Features:
1. **Home Page**: Displays a list of products fetched from a public API (FakestoreAPI).
2. **Product Detail Page**: Users can click on a product to view detailed information such as description, rating, and category.
3. **Search and Filter**: Allows users to filter products by name or category.
4. **Responsive UI**: The application is styled using Bootstrap for a clean and responsive interface.

## Features and Explanation

### 1. **Home Page (Product List)**
- The home page fetches product data from the FakestoreAPI (`https://fakestoreapi.com/products`).
- Products are displayed in a grid with essential information such as name, price, image, and a brief description.
- Clicking on a product card navigates to a detailed product page.

### 2. **Product Detail Page**
- The product detail page is dynamically rendered using React Router with URL parameters.
- Each product's detailed information (description, category, rating, etc.) is fetched using the product’s ID from the URL.
- A "Back to Products" button allows users to return to the home page.

### 3. **Search and Filter**
- The `SearchFilter` component includes a search bar to filter products by name and a dropdown to filter products by category.
- The search term and selected category are passed as state to filter products shown on the home page.

### 4. **Pagination (Optional)**
- Pagination is added to the `ProductList.js` component to limit the number of products shown per page. This helps prevent loading too many products at once.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **React Router**: For handling routing between different pages (Home Page and Product Detail Page).
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and styling.
- **FakestoreAPI**: Public API used to fetch product data.

---

## Future Improvements
- **Pagination**: Implement pagination for better user experience when displaying a large number of products.
- **Authentication**: Add user authentication to allow users to add products to a shopping cart.
- **Cart Functionality**: Implement a shopping cart to store user-selected items before checkout.
